We propose to explore the development of a performance engineering data pipeline that combines extraction of fine grained monitoring data, collation and curation of this data into a usable distributed object store, and in-situ analysis and visualization of the data to enable performance understanding at extreme scale for application developers and scientific users. Additionally we will explore the characterization of end-to-end pipelines for typical scientific workflows to better identify key optimization points and explore both application and system level optimization models for these data-centric tasks. 
The inherent complexity of extreme scale systems, combining heterogeneous processing architectures, deep memory hierarchy and severe power constraints, provides a challenge for performance engineeringâ€¦%motivation
