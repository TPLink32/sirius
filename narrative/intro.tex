\section*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item describe data size problems for getting scientific results out
\item describe annotating and differentiating data storage according to both
use and inherent data qualities (e.g., contains desireable features)
\item describe idea of using heavy compression for less interesting areas and less or no compression for more interesting areas.
\item describe inherent errors in scientific calculations
\item describe lossy compression within error bounds
\item describe how incorporating plug-ins for application aware data compression opportunities to aid data storage
\item describe Sirocco's current state and future designs as a solid foundation on which to work
\item describe how these new features can enhance a system like Sirocco to reduce data intensity
\item describe metadata challenges that we will also have to face.

\end{itemize}

every section should include:

Problem and background, one or more solution approaches, and investigation goals/questions.
