%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item describe data size problems for getting scientific results out
%\item describe annotating and differentiating data storage according to both
%  use and inherent data qualities (e.g., contains desireable features)
%\item describe idea of using heavy compression for less interesting areas
%  and less or no compression for more interesting areas.
%\item describe inherent errors in scientific calculations
%\item describe lossy compression within error bounds
%\item describe how incorporating plug-ins for application aware data
%  compression opportunities to aid data storage
%\item describe Sirocco's current state and future designs as a solid
%  foundation on which to work
%\item describe how these new features can enhance a system like Sirocco to
%  reduce data intensity
%\item describe metadata challenges that we will also have to face.
