        Abstract = {Today?s high-end massively parallel processing (MPP) machines have
        thousands to tens of thousands of processors, with next-generation
        systems planned to have in excess of one hundred thousand processors.
        For systems of such scale, efficient I/O is a significant challenge
        that cannot be solved using traditional approaches. In particular,
        general purpose parallel file systems that limit applications to
        standard interfaces and access policies do not scale and will likely
        be a performance bottleneck for many scientific applications.

        In this paper, we investigate the use of a ?lightweight? approach
        to I/O that requires the application or I/O-library developer to
        extend a core set of critical I/O functionality with the minimum
        set of features and services required by its target applications.
        We argue that this approach allows the development of I/O libraries
        that are both scalable and secure. We support our claims with preliminary
        results for a lightweight checkpoint operation on a development cluster
        at Sandia.},

 title = {D2T: Doubly Distributed Transactions for High Performance and Distributed Computing},
 abstract = {Current exascale computing projections suggest rather than a monolithic simulation running for the majority of the machine, a collection of components comprising the scientific discovery process will be employed in an online workflow. This move to an online workflow scenario requires knowledge that inter-step operations are completed and correct before the next phase begins. Further, dynamic load balancing or fault tolerance techniques may dynamically deploy or redeploy resources for optimal use of computing resources. These newly configured resources should only be used if they are successfully deployed.
Our D2T system offers a mechanism to support these kinds of operations by providing database-like transactions with distributed servers and clients. Ultimately, with adequate hardware support, full ACID compliance is possible for the transactions. To prove the viability of this approach, we show that the D2T protocol has less than 1.2 seconds of overhead using 4096 clients and 32 servers with good scaling characteristics using this initial prototype implementation.},

@inproceedings{carns:pvfs,
        Abstract = {As Linux clusters have matured as platforms for low-cost, high-performance
        parallel computing, software packages to provide many key services
        have emerged, especially in areas such as message passing and networking.
        One area devoid of support, however, has been parallel file systems,
        which are critical for high-performance I/O on such clusters. We
        have developed a parallel file system for Linux clusters, called
        the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS). PVFS is intended both as
        a high-performance parallel file system that anyone can download
        and use and as a tool for pursuing further research in parallel I/O
        and parallel file systems for Linux clusters. \par In this paper,
        we describe the design and implementation of PVFS and present performance
        results on the Chiba City cluster at Argonne. We provide performance
        results for a workload of concurrent reads and writes for various
        numbers of compute nodes, I/O nodes, and I/O request sizes. We also
        present performance results for MPI-IO on PVFS, both for a concurrent
        read/write workload and for the BTIO benchmark. We compare the I/O
        performance when using a Myrinet network versus a fast-ethernet network
        for I/O-related communication in PVFS. We obtained read and write
        bandwidths as high as 700~Mbytes/sec with Myrinet and 225~Mbytes/sec
        with fast ethernet.},

@inproceedings{weil:ceph,
        Abstract = {We have developed Ceph, a distributed file system that provides excellent
        performance, reliability, and scalability. Ceph maximizes the separation
        between data and metadata management by replacing allocation tables
        with a pseudo-random data distribution function (CRUSH) designed
        for heterogeneous and dynamic clusters of unreliable object storage
        devices (OSDs). We leverage device intelligence by distributing data
        replication, failure detection and recovery to semi-autonomous OSDs
        running a specialized local object file system. A dynamic distributed
        metadata cluster provides extremely efficient metadata management
        and seamlessly adapts to a wide range of general purpose and scientific
        computing file system workloads. Performance measurements under a
        variety of workloads show that Ceph has excellent I/O performance
        and scalable metadata management, supporting more than 250,000 metadata
        operations per second.},
