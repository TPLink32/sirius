Writing data
============

1. If the size specified to the adios_group_size is too small, the output
will be silently corrupt. Work around: make the size bigger. An error
message will be added in later releases.

Reading data
============

1. The read API defines void *mins and void *maxs returned by the adios_inq_var() funtion to contain the min/max of an array per timestep. In the current release these pointers are NULL always. 
Only the gmin and gmax single values as global min/max of an array over all timesteps are available.
