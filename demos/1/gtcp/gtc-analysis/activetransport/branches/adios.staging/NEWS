1.2.1 Released Aug 25, 2010
    - Bug fix in read API (arrays written every timestep but without time dimension caused aborts)
    - DIMES method from Rutgers

1.2 Released July 15, 2010
    - XML and non-XML write APIs are available
    - More statistics (min/max/avg/std.dev) available without
      overhead in write performance
    - Added MPI_AMR method for advanced mesh refinement codes and
      for aggregated writing (N procs to P writers to M disks)
    - Added support for subfiles
      - POSIX method many-file output can be read as one file
      - MPI_AMR method uses subfiles to improve write performance
    - Added NetCDF-4 transport method
    - Asynchronous, staging methods on Jaguar XT5 at ORNL
      - DataTap from Georgia Tech
      - DataSpaces from Rutgers
      - NSSI from Sandia
    - MPI_LUSTRE method for best performance on Lustre file system


1.0.1  Released on Dec 9, 2009
    - fix: builds read API on Mac (was broken at utils/bpdump)
    - fix: Fortran written BP files are correctly read by Fortran readers
    - added adios_mpi_stripe2 method for improved performance on Lustre file system
