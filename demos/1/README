All gtcp + analytics code is in gtcp

GTCP (GTC Proxy) has two versions, unmodified, in the repository (in the
orginal directory):
GTC_CPU_Sep13 version of GTC-P has ADIOS integrated.
GTCP_GPU_Mar14 does not.
Both of these are the original versions that have not been modified for use in
this project

GTCP_CPU_Sep13 has the modified version of the GTC proxy including writing
both the moments and particles out using ADIOS. The particles are used in the
analysis routimes. The relevant source file is restart_ion.c. The gtcp.xml is
correct for both moments and particles. There are no electrons in the proxy
so the ions are copied into the electrons for output just to provide adequte
data volumes.

in gtc-analysis/activetransport/trunk are several relevant directories:
adios_timing is the performance timing measurement routines.
ib_read are the unused, old routines for reading data via InfiniBand
analysis are the analytics routines.
Of the source files in analysis, staging.c is the modified version that reads
using ADIOS.

For the GTCP, the particle data is a 7xN array. The 6 of 7 elements are:
zion0,1,2 are the coordinates of the particle's position, zion3 is the parallel
velocity (parallel to the magnetic field), zion4 is the statistical weight, and
zion5 is the magnetic moment, which is related to the perpendicular velocity of
the particle.

The mpi_stubs is a modified version of the MPI stubs from LAMMPS with
commentary about how it needs to interact with the ADIOS mpi stubs to properly
avoid the MPI calls in the GTCP and staging.c analysis routines.
