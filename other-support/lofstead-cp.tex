{\Large Current and Pending Support for Gerald F. Lofstead}
\end{center}


Dr. Lofstead is a senior member of the technical staff in the Scalable
System Software group at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The following
table identifies current and pending support. This funding provides for effort,
travel, and resources. The effort levels will be adjusted if pending proposals
are funded, and as current projects finish.
